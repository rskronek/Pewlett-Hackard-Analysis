# Results:

# Summary: 
	* As we can see from the following, total of 72,428 employees are about to retire. 
  * There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. Even though number seems        small compared to what the new-hire number will be, there are enough experienced people to coach.
